For my final, I produced a series of generative works. My plan at the start of the project was to
develop simple algorithms built around vectors and grids, then let them evolve functionally or
aesthetically across each iteration. My inspiration comes from Casey Reas’ Process series,
John Conway’s Game of Life, and early generative artists such as Georg Nees and Frieder
Nake. I wanted to create computer driven works that feature emergence.
I was able to develop pieces
with minimal user interaction where randomness and unpredictable outcomes play a central
role. The project splits into two sections. The first explores grids, and the second focuses on
vectors.
